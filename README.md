# Hi my name is Philipp

I have a passion for programming and other computer science topics. I have been programming now for about 4 years now. My expertise lies in web technologies, especially TypeScript and JavaScript. Lately, I have also been exploring machine learning topics with Python and Tensorflow. In general, I love learning new things.
